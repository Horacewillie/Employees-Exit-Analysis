    "Thus far, we have analyzed two exit surveys done by Departmwent of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institure in Queensland Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We answered a couple of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employee who worked for the institute for a short poeriod of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who havebeen there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Are younger employees resignng due to some kind of dissatifaction? What about older employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis, we now know that most experienced employees are resigning due to some form of dissatisfaction. Acco0rding to the way our age group was categorised, Baby Boomers alongside a small group from Gen X are less satisfied with their job.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end we grouped both service categoriesa and age cateries to obtain a more detailed analysis. We observed that most people that are less satisfied with their work from the Baby Boomers age category are the Veteran, same applies to the Gen X category. This observation further solidifies our initial observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more comprehendable format, the following observations were made from the anlysis:\n",
    "New employees are generally more satisfied with their jobs than more experienced employees\n",
    "\n",
    "Baby Boomers Veterans are more satisfied with their jobs than Veterans from Gen X. This might be due to the fact that they don't have a choice as age is no longer a friend."
